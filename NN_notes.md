# Neural network notes

- Chapter 1 handwritten numeral recognition

Large number of training examples -> inference of rules

- types of artificial neuron
  - perceptron (weighted sum)
  - sigmoid neuron (squish formula)
-> main learning algorithm = stochastic decent

[PERCEPTRON]

- takes in several binary inputs and outputs their weighted sum
